# 1-Wire search algorithm

This project provides a reimplemented 1-Wire bus search algorithm 
(used to identify e.g. DS18x20 thermometers on a common open-drain bus).

The algorithm uses no global variables and allows finding 
a unlimited number of bus devices.

For an example of usage, see `main.c`.
